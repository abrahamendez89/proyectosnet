NuGet Packages
=================================

To make it easer for you to develop with the Google APIs using the Google API client Library for .NET we have released a number of NuGet packages. A full list of all the avaliable packages can be found at the [Google.APIs NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=google.apis&sortOrder=relevance) page.

Source for APIs
=================================

The source code for the individual Google APIs is programmatically generated using the [Discovery API](https://developers.google.com/discovery/). <br/> Using the following formula, you can find the source for any of the API dlls:
<br/>
https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/API_NAME/API_VERSION/csharp <br/>

Replace API_NAME with the name of the API. <br/>
Replace API_VERSION with the version of the API.

Examples:

* [https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/analytics/v3/csharp](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/analytics/v3/csharp) for Analytics v3
* [https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/drive/v2/csharp](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/drive/v2/csharp) for Drive v2

Tip: If you are unsure of the name and/or the version of the API, you can check it using the Discovery API at the bottom of the [Discovery list](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference/apis/list) page.
